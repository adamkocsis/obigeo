# obigeo
R package for pattern extraction from occurrence-record biogeography data

This package is still in development. 

After installing, type in
```r
?bgpart
```
to see the main function for biogeographic partitioning. 

You can find an example script in the `_tutorials` directory.

## Installing 

As the package now uses compiled code to make things run faster, there are two ways to install.

1. Install Rtools (Windows) or XCode (Mac).
2. Make sure that the devtools package is installed

```r
devtools::install_github("adamkocsis/obigeo")
```
